## Process
  - Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
  - Make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to the data type, format and values used.
  - Created Matrix tables and datatables,linecharts, barcharts to the questions asked.
  - Merge all the visualizations into one Dashboard and apply slicers to make dynamic.

## Project insights based on the dashboard:
1. Central Region Leads: Central region dominates in both sales and profit.
2. Tech Drives Sales: Technology category has the highest sales volume.
3. Profit Varies Greatly: Profitability differs significantly by sub-category and customer segment.
4. South Has Sales Opportunity: South region has high sales but lower profit, needing attention.
5. Discounts are Frequent: High discount usage suggests a need to analyze their impact on profit.

## The Final Conclusion:

The Global Superstore shows strong overall sales, primarily driven by the Central region and the Technology category. However, significant profit variations exist across regions and product sub-categories, with the South region presenting a sales opportunity but lower profitability. A high reliance on discounts warrants analysis to optimize profitability. Strategic focus should be on leveraging successful regions and categories while addressing underperforming ones and refining pricing/discount strategies.
