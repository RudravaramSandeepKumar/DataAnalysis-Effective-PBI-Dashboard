# DataAnalysis-Effective-PBI-Dashboard
This repository contains a comprehensive PowerBI visualization dashboard showcasing key metrics, trends, and insights for [Global Superstore Data]. The dashboard is designed to provide actionable information through interactive visualizations, charts, and graphs and Influencers.

# Global-Superstore Data Analysis(Interactive and Effective Dashboard Creation Using Microsoft PowerBI)

## Project Objective

The global superstore data used to create an interactive visuals using those feature to see the trends/futrure sales of the data, in this I have created an essential KPIs based on that data to see th trends over sale by orders of the store data and created a effective and important visuals to determine the customers behavioural of orders.

## Dataset Used
<a href = "https://github.com/RudravaramSandeepKumar/DataAnalysis-Effective-PBI-Dashboard/blob/main/Global%20Superstore.xls">Dataset</a>

## Question KPIs
1. Essential KPIs for sales profit and discount 
2. Total sales and profits by regions(table)
3. Total sales by category and sub category?
4. Total sales and profits by quantity of the products(line column)
5. Sum of the profit by regions(pie)
6. Matrix table for profits of sub category 
7. Trends over segments by sales and profits.
8. Map chart for total profits
9. Treemaps for categories of sales.
10. Quantity of sales by sub-category
11. Key influencers of sales and profits over category.
12. Decomposition tree for quantity of sales to capture accuracy

## Process
  - Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
  - Make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to the data type, format and values used.
  - Created Matrix tables and datatables,linecharts, barcharts to the questions asked.
  - Merge all the visualizations into one Dashboard and apply slicers to make dynamic.

## KeyFact Observations From the Dashboard

- The region central sales, profits and quantity is details we can see from the dash board using **PIE CHART** slice visual.
- It interacted with the other visuals for the same data for Central Region. Refer the below fig.

- In the below visual we can see the sales Data of only **DECEMBER** month for **CONSUMER** Category
- Using the **Line Stacked chart** of 1st Visual all the sales and profits interacts with all other visuals. Refer below

- In this visual I have used **Sync Slicer** to slice all the pages of the data.
- You can see the visual dashboard only sliced for from **Jan-01-2012 to December-31-2013** It filtered only these 2 years of data.
- In the report dashboard to present data effectively. In the second pic you can see the tables and visuals the calculations are different because 
  only 2 data years data is sliced. Refer the below Visuals figures.

## Project insights based on the dashboard:
1. Central Region Leads: Central region dominates in both sales and profit.
2. Tech Drives Sales: Technology category has the highest sales volume.
3. Profit Varies Greatly: Profitability differs significantly by sub-category and customer segment.
4. South Has Sales Opportunity: South region has high sales but lower profit, needing attention.
5. Discounts are Frequent: High discount usage suggests a need to analyze their impact on profit.

## The Final Conclusion:

The Global Superstore shows strong overall sales, primarily driven by the Central region and the Technology category. However, significant profit variations exist across regions and product sub-categories, with the South region presenting a sales opportunity but lower profitability. A high reliance on discounts warrants analysis to optimize profitability. Strategic focus should be on leveraging successful regions and categories while addressing underperforming ones and refining pricing/discount strategies.
